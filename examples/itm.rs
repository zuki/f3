//! Sends "Hello, world!" through the first ITM stimulus port
//!
//! To receive the message on the host you'll have to do three things:
//!
//! You'll need to uncomment lines 8 and 15 of the `.gdbinit` file.
//!
//! You'll also need to connect the SWO pin of the on-board SWD programmer to pin PB3 as shown
//! [here](https://rust-embedded.github.io/discovery/06-hello-world/index.html).
//!
//! Finally, you'll need to run `itmdump itm.fifo` (mind the file paths) to receive the message.
//! Read the documentation of the [`itm`] crate, which provides the `itmdump` tool,  for details.
//!
